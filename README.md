Original exercise content listed two questions:
Bonus Questions:
1. Could you propose different model/method (OA uses logistic regression) for Optiparm Algorithm?
2. How to improve raw output of the Optiparm Algorithm?
    
Let me answer them:
1. Recent experience with writing research papers taught me to check existing reports on method improvement: the great answer to this question could be found in this article: https://www.finalyse.com/blog/machine-learning-in-risk-management and in this paper: https://www.bis.org/ifc/events/ifc_9thconf/Petropoulos.pdfI would definitely need much more time to give a better answer than the two linked texts.
2. The original output is to be given in a numerical table with columns: rating, number, lower, higher, observed. Tables are great for data manipulation, however, they are poorly read by humans. Visual representation is much more human-friendly. This could be rendered using tools like matplotlib or plotly.
